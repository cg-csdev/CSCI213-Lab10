This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, `Car.java`, which extends the abstract `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class contains the following:

- Two instance variables
- A parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
- Getters for the instance variables in this class
- The `toString` method
- The `equals` method
- A `copy` method
